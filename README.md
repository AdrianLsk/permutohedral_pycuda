# permutohedral_pycuda
Attempt to use permutohedral lattice cuda implementation from python using pycuda and later on as theano Op.
Original reference with CUDA code: http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/permutohedral/.
Current state: not working.
Need to resolve how to create an array of structs with pycuda.
